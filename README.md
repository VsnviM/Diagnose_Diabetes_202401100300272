# 🩺 Diagnose Diabetes

This project uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** to build a machine learning classification model that predicts whether a person has diabetes based on medical attributes.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Use patient medical records to classify if an individual has diabetes. Early prediction can help in timely intervention and better management of the disease.

---

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Place the dataset file `2. Diagnose Diabetes.csv` in the same directory.
3. Open the Python script or Jupyter Notebook (if applicable).
4. Run all the cells or execute the script to train the model and evaluate performance.

## 🔧 Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Loaded and cleaned the CSV data.
2. **Train-Test Split:** 80-20 split for training and testing.
3. **Model Used:** Random Forest Classifier.
4. **Evaluation:** 
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
5. **Visualization:** Confusion matrix plotted using Seaborn heatmap.


## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics (Sample)

- **Accuracy:** 0.72
- **Precision:** 0.61 
- **Recall:** 0.62
